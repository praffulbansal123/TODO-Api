# TODO-Api

## Project's Title: "TODO Applicatiom"

### Project's Description: 
In this project, I have created 2 services:
 1) USER:  registration, login, update details and logout
 2) TODO:  create, get, update and delete

#### Approach:

--I have created an index file, in which I have imported express framework, https-errors for halding errors and dotenv for securing important keys.
--I have used express routing to create a mini-app, named  user route and todo route, in which I have created required APIs.
--I have created controllers and services where business logic is kept.
--To validate each field of request headers, I have imported JOI validator.
--I have used JEST for unit testing
